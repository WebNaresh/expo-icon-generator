don't give the long description what you have done give only bullets point
alwasy divide task in task list
never create test scripts or documentation files without explicit permission - always ask first before creating any additional files beyond the core implementation requested
alwasy use shadcn component
before coding if you doing anything if possible if you need docs use usecontext7 if you are building next js page then useContext7 for the docs to building a page or anything if you are usinig usequeyr or anything analyze their docs also
